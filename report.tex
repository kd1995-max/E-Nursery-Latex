		\chapter{Hardware and Software requirement}
		\section{Introduction}
		\paragraph
		{
			In this chapter we mentioned the software and hardware requirements, which are necessary for successfully running this system. The major element in building systems is selecting compatible hardware and software. The system analyst has to determine what software package is best for the “E Nursery System” and, where software is not an issue, the kind of hardware and peripherals needed for the final conversion.
		}
		\section{System environment}
		\paragraph
		{
			After analysis, some resources are required to convert the abstract system into the real one. All the resources, which accomplish a robust The hardware and software selection begins with requirement analysis, followed by a request for proposal and vendor evaluation.
		}
		\paragraph
		{
			Software and real system are identified. According to the provided functional specification all the technologies and its capacities are identified. Basic functions and procedures and methodologies are prepared to implement. Some of the Basic requirements such as hardware and software are described as follows: -

		\chapter{Conclusion}
		\paragraph
		{
			The project entitled “E Nursery Shop” is developed using HTML, CSS and javascript as frontend and Python programming language and Sqlite database in backend to computerize the process of online shopping. This project covers only the basic features required.
		}
		\section{Features of “E Nursery”}

			\item Intelligent User Forms Design
			      \begin{itemize}
			      	\item Data access and manipulation through same forms
			      	\item Access to most required information
			      \end{itemize}
			                  
			\item Data Security 
			\item Restrictive data access, as per login assigned only.
			\item Organized and structured storage of facts.
			\item Strategic Planning made easy.
			\item No decay of old Records.
			\item Exact financial position of the Business.
		\end{itemize}

		\section{Limitations of  “E Nursery”}
		\paragraph
		{
			Besides the above achievements and the successful completion of the project, we still feel the project has some limitations, listed as below:
		}
		        
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item It is not a large scale system. 
			\item Only limited information provided by this system. 
			\item Since it is an online project, customers need internet connection to buy products
			\item People who are not familiar with computers can’t use this software.
		\end{enumerate}
		\chapter{Future Scope}
		\paragraph
		{
			This web application involves almost all the features of the online shopping. The future implementation will be online help for the customers and chatting with website administrator.
