The \textbf{ADMIN} has all the rights in the software including updating the status of his site. The other fields in login are username and password. If the username and password are correct then it is directed to next page.
            \item \textbf{New user:} This module is for the users who do not have their account. Here user is allowed to create an account to login. The account creation is done by filling the registration form with user details such as name, phone, email etc.
            \item \textbf{Product:} This module has information regarding the product such as its name, category, subcategory, image, price information; its features etc.The \textbf{ADMIN} has the authority to Add, Delete, and Update etc. The \textbf{USER} can only view the product available in the stock etc.
            \item \textbf{Search:} This module helps the customer to ease his search based on his budget or interest. The search can be done on different categories and subcategories like category , subcategory , name, price etc
        \end{itemize}
    \chapter{Implementation issues}
        \section{Python}
        \paragraph
        {
        Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
        }
        \section{HTML}
        \paragraph
        {
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page. The markup tells the Web browser how to display a Web page's words and images for the user. Each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag). Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
        }
        \section{Cascading style sheet(CSS)}
        \paragraph
        {
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a collection of rules we use to define and modify web pages.  CSS are similar to styles in Word.  CSS allow Web designers to have much more control over their pages look and layout.  For instance, you could create a style that defines the body text to be Verdana, 10 point. Later on, you may easily change the body text to Times New Roman, 12 point by just changing the rule in the CSS.  Instead of having to change the font on each page of your website, all you need to do is redefine the style on the style sheet, and it will instantly change on all of the pages that the style sheet has been applied to. With HTML styles, the font change would be applied to each instance of that font and have to be changed in each spot.  
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        CSS can control the placement of text and objects on your pages as well as the look of those objects.
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        HTML information creates the objects (or gives objects meaning), but styles describe how the objects should appear. The HTML gives your page structure, while the CSS creates the “presentation”.  An external CSS is really just a text file with a .css extension.  These files can be created with Dreamweaver, a CSS editor, or even Notepad.
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        The best practice is to design your web page on paper first so you know where you will want to use styles on your page. Then you can create the styles and apply them to your page.
        }
        \section{Javascript}
        \paragraph
        {
        JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced byJava, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems. 
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without COMMUNICATING with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server. 
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.
        }
        \section{Django}
        \paragraph
        {
        Django is a web application framework written in Python programming language. It is based on MVT (Model View Template) design pattern. The Django is very demanding due to its rapid development feature. It takes less time to build application after collecting client requirement.
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        This framework uses a famous tag line: The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.
        }
        \section{Sqlite}
        \paragraph
        {
        SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private. SQLite is the most widely deployed database in the world with more applications than we can count, including several high-profile projects.

        Use case diagram consists of use cases and actors and shows the interaction between them. The key points are: }
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The main purpose is to show the interaction between the use cases and the actor.
            \item To represent the system requirement from user’s perspective. 
            \item The use cases are the functions that are to be performed in the module.

        \paragraph
        {
        A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through an Information System. A data flow diagram can also be used for the visualization of Data Processing. It is common practice for a designer to draw a context-level DFD first which shows the interaction between the system and outside entities. This context-level DFD is then "exploded" to show more detail of the system being modeled.
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        A DFD represents flow of data through a system. Data flow diagrams are commonly used during problem analysis. It views a system as a function that transforms the input into desired output. A DFD shows movement of data through the different transformations or processes in the system.
        }
        \paragraph
        {
         Dataflow diagrams can be used to provide the end user with a physical idea of where the data they input ultimately has an effect upon the structure of the whole system from order to dispatch to restock how any system is developed can be determined through a dataflow diagram. The appropriate register saved in database and maintained by appropriate authorities.

        \paragraph
        {
        An entity-relationship (ER) diagram is a specialized graphic that illustrates the interrelationships between entities in a database. ER diagrams often use symbols to represent three different types of information. Boxes are commonly used to represent entities. Diamonds are normally used to represent relationships and ovals are used to represent attributes
        }
        \paragraph
        {
        An \textbf{entity-relationship model} (ERM) in software engineering is an abstract and conceptual representation of data. Entity-relationship modeling is a relational schema database modeling method, used to produce a type of conceptual schema or semantic data model of a system, often a relational database, and its requirements in a top-down fashion.
